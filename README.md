# Countdown Timer

A simple counter timer that allows fast forwarding at 1.5x and 2x

## Install & Run

```
git clone {repoUrl}
yarn // installs dependencies
yarn start // then access in browser on localhost:300
```

## Usage

Enter a time you wish to count down from and click "Start."

The timer will count down to 0 with some special effects along the way.

The speed controls work as you'd expect.
